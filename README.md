# MONTY PROJECT TEST CASE SUITE

## OVERVIEW

Each folder represents each task to check your source code. Copy your compiled C binary into the directory/task you would like to test, then run the specific bash file to see if you are passing that specific test condition.

## HOW TO USE

- Clone the repo [test_monty](https://github.com/kirubel-web/test_monty.git)
```
git clone https://github.com/kirubel-web/test_monty.git

cd /test_monty
```

- Copy the source file into the directory/task folder you want to test for in the test_monty/task_XX directory

- binary is 'monty'
```
cp <path/to/monty/binary> task_XX/.
```

- run the test
```
./<specific_test>.sh
```
